// State variables are the variable which are inside the contract but outside the function.

// Some important points about state variables --->

/*
 1.  We can create asd many state variables but we don't create much because they are directly stored on the blockchain 
      in the contract storage which cost some gas.
 
 2. Once the contract is deployed then we cannot change anything what we have to do is we have to compile the contract again
    and once again we have to deploy it
